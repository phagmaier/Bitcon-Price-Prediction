You should eliminate one of the features that perfectly correlate and consider reducing the number
of features after that to see if that improves it. Note that you should try feature elimination
after removing the one of the pairs of features that perfectly correlate

Once you do this for the linear model then you can move on to LSTM 

You should also eliminate cryp diff and stock diff there correlation is abysmal


YOU MAY ALSO BE BETTER OFF PREDICTING PRICE and then calculating the change since more features seem to fall in line with this 

You may also want to do less shit with data just give it the price the volume the cap etc...
and just work like that to predict the next days price

Should probably just generate classes of: BUY, SELL, DO NOTHING
if increases is above 3% buy if bellow 3% sell and if in between do nothing
Can also add more shit like if it's 5 or above do definitely buy and -5 then definitely sell
